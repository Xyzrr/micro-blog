<h1>What people think of you</h1>

	Growing up, I really bought into the idea that it doesn't matter what people think of you outside
	of a few good friends. I've gradually come to realize how wrong that was. If you work hard your
	whole life, your individual skill level probably plateaus around age 25-30. Thereafter, nearly all
	career progression comes from gains in social capital, aka what people think of you. And because
	social capital compounds over time, it's best to start caring what people think of you as young as
	possible.

	The advice to not care what others think comes from good intentions, of course. The default way we
	care about others' opinions--the way we were genetically programmed to--is extremely suboptimal in
	the modern world. We were programmed for a world where nearly every person we met would likely
	remain part of our lives permanently, and where any feedback we received was much more likely to
	be life-or-death. Consequently, we're way too affected by the opinion of whoever happens to be
	talking to us, especially when it's negative.

<p>
	So you have to suppress your primal feelings and instead care about peoples' opinions of you
	proportionally to how much they actually matter. But there's a lot of art that goes into that.
	Most people whose opinions matter are people you never met, and you need a very good world model
	to accurately estimate who might matter for you. Moreover, you don't necessarily care about their
	opinions of you today, you care what their opinion will be when you need them.

	I only started noticing the value of social capital after I became a founder. As an engineer
	working a normal job, it's hard to convert social capital into money. But as a founder, your
	social capital suddenly becomes one of the main bottlenecks to success. Winning the
	gratitude/trust/respect of someone is a lot like buying a call option on them. There's theta decay
	as they gradually forget about you, but if they become successful down the road--especially if
	it's partly because of you--you can 'exercise' your option for a lot of value.

	This is why Sam Altman, possibly the greatest social capital accumulator to ever live, was known
	for taking cold calls from 15 year old kids. Before he became too famous, this was a very good
	filter; if a kid knew who Sam Altman was and had the agency to cold call him, that kid was
	probably going to become fairly successful. The most SPY ever grew in a year is 31.3%. A
	hyper-ambitious kid may grow that much every 6 months. That's a good investment.
