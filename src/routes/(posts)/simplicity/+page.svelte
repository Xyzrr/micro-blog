<h1>Simplicity scarcity</h1>
<div class="opacity-60 mb-8">Janurary 2023</div>
<p>
	Most people find complex things (products, thought pieces, etc.) more impressive than simple
	things. Much of academic writing rides on this premise. In tech, it can slow adoption of new
	products. Anything sleeker than Salesforce must not be as powerful, right?
</p>
<p>
	The complexity bias exists because when you look around, smarter people have more complex ideas.
	But that's because smarter people work on harder problems. When you stratify problem space by
	difficulty, smarter people have simpler ideas.
</p>
<p>
	Given a problem, the first solution you find generally has excess complexity. It's a semi-random
	point in the solution space, so it's statistically unlikely to be the simplest. Simplification
	requires you to keep searching, with each reduction taking exponentially longer, because there's
	exponentially fewer simple solutions than there are complex ones. Situations where this hard work
	is incentivized are scarce. Often you just need a working solution and complexity doesn't matter.
	And too often there's an incentive to <em>increase</em> complexity--to obfuscate. The four main reasons
	are:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			To appear smart. This is common in academia, consulting, and any other setting where receiving
			money requires convincing non-experts that you’re smart. When they don’t know of a simpler
			solution themselves, they’ll use the complexity of your solution as a proxy for the difficulty
			of the problem you’ve solved.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			To create a barrier to entry. This trick is often used by lawyers to ensure that clients keep
			coming back to them to ask questions about the documents they wrote rather than simply reading
			the documents themselves. It’s also used by the Myers-Biggs Type Indicator; if their
			"personality traits" were English words used correctly, like in the <a
				target="_blank"
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">Big Five</a
			>, people wouldn’t need a test to know where they fall.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			To avoid offending people. Simple explanations can be offensive. Sometimes, their simplicity
			is the very reason for their offensiveness. Verbosity is a core tenet of politeness; it shows
			you put in effort. When you make a topic seem simple, it can offend those who spent years
			studying the topic. Other times, simple explanations are offensive because they’re more true
			than the standard narrative. Truth tends to be simpler than fiction because logical
			consistency is built-in, and fictions often exist to mask offensive truths. Many social
			phenomena can be explained more simply, but elaborating this point on the public internet
			would not be worth it for me.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			To publish a book. Although this is usually just a special case of #1, publishing books can
			genuinely help you reach audiences that other mediums can’t. But there’s a perverse
			expectation for books to be a certain size, a size far beyond the scope of the average
			author’s original ideas. So most books end up being a page worth of ideas dragged out to
			book-length via needless anecdotes, examples, analogies, definitions, quotes, flowery prose,
			and paraphrasings of Wikipedia pages, interlaced with rehashes of the main point.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Sometimes it may seem the incentive is to simplify, when it isn't. To make a piece of content
	viral, it needs to be simple enough for a layperson to consume. But because simplification is so
	difficult, creators usually instead dumb down the material, stripping out or falsifying the parts
	that are hard to understand. Consumers leave satisfied because they’re ill-equipped to realize
	they missed the important parts.
</p>
<p>
	Consequently, almost everything we see in the world is either dumbed down or overcomplicated. Most
	people never realize hard things can be simpler.
</p>
<p>Simplicity has three benefits:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Minimizes time-to-fully-understand.</p></li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Generalizes better. A derivative of Occam’s razor is that simpler solutions tend to cover more
			cases.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Is memorable for longer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
	Very occasionally are these advantages are so desired and unadulterated that an idea is
	distributed in its simplest form. It can happen when someone is financially dependent on the
	efficacy of other peoples’ long-term execution--Paul Graham, for example, wrote simple startup
	advice for the companies he invested in. It can also happen when someone wants to target people
	who appreciate simplicity, as is the case with 3blue1brown. But most often, simplified ideas are
	kept secret, for personal use and close friends. The simplest version of any idea is probably in
	someone’s private journal.
