	In high school, kids were brutally honest. Whenever I did something foolish, other kids would make
	sure I knew. Taken to the extreme, this becomes bullying. But I think the level of criticism I
	received in high school was net beneficial for me. Not all of the feedback was worth following,
	but it was always useful to know what people honestly thought.
</p>
<p>
	As I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed that criticisms have gotten rarer. In college, flattery became
	more common than criticism. Post-college, it&#39;s become unusual to hear any form of negativity
	cast upon someone in the same room. Giving unsolicited feedback has almost become a sign of social
	ineptitude.
</p>
<p>
	I think there’s many reasons for this, but the main one is that as you get older, you become less
	“stuck” to people [1]. Most kids in high school have a few friends that they do everything
	together with, and they know they&#39;ll be together for 4 years. So when someone in the group has
	a character flaw, it&#39;s easier to make them fix it than to ignore it. But as you get older, you
	develop multiple disparate friend groups, and forced social interactions become more rare. So when
	one of your friends has a character flaw, you can opt to avoid doing activities with them where
	that flaw poses a problem. You can just enjoy the good parts of each friend you have.
</p>
<p>
	I think this is an under-appreciated reason that adults tend to calcify their ideas and habits. No
	one tells them when they’re wrong because it’s not worth it [2].
</p>
<p>
	So if you want to keep improving like you did in high school, what can you do about this? I think
	it&#39;s a hard problem. Explicitly asking your friends for feedback may help, but not
	necessarily. I once overheard an executive say, &quot;when someone asks me for honest criticism, I
	almost never actually give it to them. Unless they&#39;re my employee, there&#39;s just no value
	in it for me.&quot; So is the solution to ask your manager for feedback? Probably not; it&#39;s
	never worked for me. As long as you do your job fine, your manager doesn&#39;t have much incentive
	to give you criticism either.
</p>
<p>I can think of only two partial solutions.</p>
<p>
	The first is to improve at reading people. This is expected and obligatory, and may actually be
	another reason why adults criticize less than children. They expect you to notice increasingly
	subtle hints, so that they never have to say anything directly.
</p>
<p>
	The other is to find a committed romantic partner. This creates a situation similar to the high
	school friend group. Your partner has to deal with your flaws every day, and may even be judged
	for them. So they&#39;re incentivized to actually fix you.
</p>
<p>
	I don&#39;t find either of these solutions really satisfying. Sometimes I wish people would
	continue to spout their thoughts unfiltered like they did in high school. Fortunately by being
	aware of the problem, you can avoid calcifying too early.
</p>
<p class="pt-16">
	[1] I originally thought that it’s because it takes time to realize that fixing people isn’t worth
	it. I no longer think this is the reason; in high school, fixing people often is worth it. Kids
	are quick at learning what behaviors work; what takes time is unlearning behaviors that have
	stopped working.
</p>
<p>
	[2] A surprising implication of this is that giving someone criticism is a powerful statement of
	loyalty. It means you intend on spending enough time with them for them to be worth fixing. Of
	course, this positive message may not get through.
